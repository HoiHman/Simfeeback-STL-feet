## Assembly
### 0) clean the hollow shaft

- the hardened steel hollow shaft is grinded to its precise diameter
- there are remains of the abrasive material inside the shaft which needs to be cleaned properly


### 1) M8 thread inserts

- let's start with the most tricky part of the hardware assembly
- lubricate inserts with oil
- carefully screw in the M8 thread inserts into the aluminium profile
- inserts need to be as perpendicular as possible!

- lots of torque will be required to screw in the inserts
- cut M12 threads into the aluminium profile if the required torque is too much

### 2) grease nipple (optional)

- screw in the grease nipple into the ball nut
- this is the last chance to fill up the nut with bearing grease using a grease gun

### 3) ball screw

do not remove the ball nut from the ball screw at any point!

- slide the bump stop, o-ring and fixed bearing onto the ball screw
- check orientations of the parts as per the picture

- to tighten the fixed bearing nut, clamp the ball screw in a vise
- drop a bit of screw lock on the thread
- tighten the nut as strong as possible - without the fixed bearing to get stuck
- use the worm screw to secure the nut

- attach the slider to the ball nut

### 4) aluminium profile mounts

- bolt the fixed bearing to its 3d-printed mount

![](https://github.com/SimFeedback/SimFeedback-AC-Servo/blob/master/Docs/08_fixed_bearing.jpg)

- attach the linear bearing mount loosely - do not tighten the bolts yet

- attach the linear bearing loosely - do not tighten the bolts yet

### 5) close the internals

- insert the hollow shaft into the slider
- use a layer of masking tape to adjust the gap
- shaft should stick a little bit

![](https://github.com/SimFeedback/SimFeedback-AC-Servo/blob/master/Docs/13_shaft.jpg)

- lubricate the linear bearing with grease
- turn the slider near the end of the ball screw (extended position) - yet not too far!
- put the top assembly into the aluminium profile all the way through
- now tighten the linear bearing and its mount

![](https://github.com/SimFeedback/SimFeedback-AC-Servo/blob/master/Docs/15_assembly.jpg)

- turn the ball screw so that the actuator pulls the shaft inside
- a screw driver is recommended - or use the shaft coupling (next step) now

![](https://github.com/SimFeedback/SimFeedback-AC-Servo/blob/master/Docs/16_assembly.jpg)

- now tighten the fixed bearing mount properly

### 6) attach servo motor

- mount the shaft coupling to the ball screw
- position the coupling roughly to the fixed bearing top surface
- tighten the ball screw side of the coupling

![](https://github.com/SimFeedback/SimFeedback-AC-Servo/blob/master/Docs/17_coupling.jpg)
![](https://github.com/SimFeedback/SimFeedback-AC-Servo/blob/master/Docs/18_coupling.jpg)

- turn the coupling so that the motor mount slot hole gives access to the screw
- attach motor mount and servo motor temporarily
- tighten the motor side of the coupling

![](https://github.com/SimFeedback/SimFeedback-AC-Servo/blob/master/Docs/19_coupling.jpg)

- remove motor and its mount to properly tighten the coupling
