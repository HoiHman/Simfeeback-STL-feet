Welcome to the SimFeedback-AC-Servo Wiki!

This Wiki will be the central place for all kind of information like build and setup instructions for the SimFeedback-AC DIY Motion Simulator Platform.

SimFeedback is a PC software, that will receive telemetry data from Racing games/simulations like iRacing, Assetto Corsa, Project Cars, ... . This data is used to create motion cues by transforming them into motion commands.

In this Version, motion commands will be send to a mirco controller (Arduino based) that will control closed loop AC Servos to drive our DIY Linear Actuators (SFX-100).

## What is so special 

We do use our own made DIY Actuators - SFX-100!

It is a linear actuator (ballscrew) driven by a powerful 750 watt AC Servo.
All parts are of the shelf or 3D-Printed.


The Design is free for all but for commercial use. See our [license](./License).

We will show you how to build the **SFX-100 DIY actuators**, the Electronics, the Software and get all of this up and running.
