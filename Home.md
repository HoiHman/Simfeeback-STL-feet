Welcome to the SimFeedback-AC-Servo Wiki!

This Wiki will be the central place for all kinds of information like build and setup instructions for the SimFeedback-AC DIY Motion Simulator Platform.

SimFeedback is a PC software, that will receive telemetry data from Racing games/simulations like iRacing, Assetto Corsa or Project Cars. This data is used to create motion cues by transforming them into motion commands.

In this Version, motion commands will be send to a mirco controller (Arduino based) that will control closed loop AC Servos.

You can learn how to build the DIY actuators (name still missing), the Electronics, the Software and get all of this up and running.

This project is in pre alpha stage.
We run a closed beta test.
