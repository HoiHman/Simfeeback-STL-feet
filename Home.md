Welcome to the SimFeedback-AC-Servo wiki!

This Wiki will be the central place for information, build and setup instructions for the SimFeedback DIY Motion Simulator Platform.

SimFeedback is a PC software that will receive telemetry data from Racing games/simulations like iRacing, Assetto Corsa or Project Cars. This information is used to create motion cues by transforming them into motion commands.

In this Version, motion commands will be send to a mirco controller (Arduino based) that will control closed loop AC Servos.
